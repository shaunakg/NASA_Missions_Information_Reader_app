# NASA Missions Information Reader
This app gets a database of NASA links and aggregates them in a clean interface. I am just starting to learn android coding so it will definetely by sloppy and inefficient, if you have any suggestions at all please report them to the Issues tab (above).

The missions_database.csv file is the actual database that the program syncs to. No pull request will be accepted if the edit that file, only suggesting in the Issues tab.
