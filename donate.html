<h2>Thank you for taking the time to use this app, and for trying to donate. However, I will not accept donations for what is essentially a proof-of-concept. So, this page will redirect you in 10 seconds to a charity I like. If you really want to donate, you can give them the money to help find a cure for cancer. Thank you once again! 💗</h2>
